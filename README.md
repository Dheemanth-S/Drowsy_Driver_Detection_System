# Drowsy Driver Detection System

A real-time computer vision project that detects driver drowsiness using **Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascade, and facial landmark detection (LBF model)**. The system monitors **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** to classify driver states as **Active, Drowsy, or Sleeping**, and triggers audio alerts to help prevent fatigue-related accidents.
